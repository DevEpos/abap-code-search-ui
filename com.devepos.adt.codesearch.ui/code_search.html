	<p>
		The <i>ABAP Code Search +</i> is a tool which offers the possibility to search in abap source code for a given string, similar to the ABAP Source Code Search. 
            The advantages of the ABAP Code Search+ are: 
            <ul id="advantages" class="list">
                   <li>works also for R/3 environments </li>
                   <li>allows a more detailed scope definition with filtering by object type, application component, etc... </li>
                   <li>supports more specific search patterns with regex and multiline search</li>
            It is integrated in the eclipse <i>Search</i> dialog, which can be
		called via
		<code class="code">STRG</code>
		+
		<code class="code">H</code>
		or the eclipse menu <i>Search âž  Search...</i>

	<!-- Description of general setup of the Search view -->
	<p>The Code Search Dialog Page is structured into the following
		controls</p>
	<ol class="list">
		<li>A Text Area to enter the search pattern</li>
		<li>3 Checkboxes to configure the search pattern regarding case sensitivity, if regular expressions are used and if the search string should be applied as a single pattern ( relevant for multiline strings) </li>
		<li>A text input control to enter object name to restrict the scope</li>
                <li>A text input control to enter the filters for the scope. The control
			supports content assist</li>
		<li>3 Checkboxes to configure the search scope: if comment lines should be ignored, if it is a multiline search and if the matches should include all lines from the search pattern
		</li>
                <li>A link to the preferences, where some more project specific configuration options can de done </li>
		<li>A Scale to control the maximum number of search objects that
			should be scanned </li>
		<li>A text input control to enter the target ABAP Project. The
			control supports content assist</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="heading">Content Assist</h3>
	<p>
		The Text Control for entering the filters for the scope provides assistance for
		the following criteria. The available filters depend on the
		current <em>ABAP Project</em>.

<h4 class="heading">Configuring the search pattern</h4>
	<p> 
	You have 3 option to configure the search pattern
        <ol class="list">
		<li>Ignore Case: setting this check box will result in applying the search pattern in upper case </li>
  		<li>Regular Expressions:  by setting this checkbox you specify that the entered pattern uses regular expression ( depending on the system you can even use PCRE see project specific settings) </li>
                <li>Single Pattern mode: To-do 
</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="and_search_for_filter">Additional search
		settings</h3>
	<h4 class="heading">
		Use logical <strong>AND</strong> for options of search filters
	</h4>
	<p>
		Normally the options of a search filter are interpreted with a logical
		<code class="code">
			<strong>OR</strong>
		</code>
		. So if you have the following query:
		<code class="code">
			<strong>field</strong>: product,plant
		</code>
		, the search would return all objects that have a field named <em>product</em>
		<code class="code">
			<strong>or</strong>
		</code>
		a field named <em>plant</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		But sometimes you may want to find only the objects that have all the
		specified fields. In this case you have to activate the setting <em>Use
			"AND" instead of "OR" during search</em>. You can do this by setting the
		checkbox in the search dialog (see <a class="link" href="#figure1">Figure
			1</a>)
	</p>
	<p>Regardless of it's activation state this setting will only be
		used for search filters where it makes sense, i.e. where multiple
		values are at all possible.</p>
<h3 class="heading">The Search result View</h3>
	<h4 class="heading">Working with the Search Results</h4>
	<p>Once a search returns some results they are displayed in the
		Search View. For each found object there are several options available</p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>Opening the object in the corresponding eclipse editor (if
			one is registered for the type) by double clicking on it</li>
		<li>Open one or several selected objects via the context menu
			item <code class="code">Open</code>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		If the tree node represents a <em>CDS View</em>, a <em>Database
			Table</em> or a <em>Database View</em> There are also the following
		options available via the context menu
	</p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>Open the selected objects in the <em>Data Preview</em> of ADT
		</li>
		<li>Open the selected objects in the SAP GUI Transaction <em>DB
				Browser</em><br>
			<blockquote>
				<strong>Note</strong>: The DB Browser feature needs to be installed
				in the ABAP System for this to work
			</blockquote></li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class="heading">Sub Nodes of a Result Object</h4>
	<p>
		Every Result Object can be expanded to at least one level. Upon
		expansion of one of these <em>ADT</em> objects, the sub nodes of the
		object will be loaded. During the loading of the object's sub nodes
		you will see a sub node called <em>Loading Contents...</em>.
	</p>
	<p>Once the sub nodes are available they will be displayed under
		the ADT object</p>
	<!-- <blockquote>
		<strong>Note:</strong> The loading time depends greatly on the installed Database (server) of the
		ABAP Project
	</blockquote> -->
