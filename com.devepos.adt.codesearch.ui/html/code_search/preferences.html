	<h3 class="heading">General Settings</h3>
	<p>In the preferences menu you have the possibility to configure
		the following settings
	<ul class="list">
		<li><em>Max. number of objects to search in a single request</em>
			<br> this option allows you to control the number of development
			objects which should be scanned in a single search request. A search
			request is not the same as the whole search run. A search run is
			split into multiple search request(see The Search Result View for
			more details )</li>
		<li><em>Reuse search query when opened from the result view</em><br>
			If you spend a lot of time refining your search queries and do not
			want to fill up the history of the search view, this option</li>
		<li><em>Concatenate lines of the search pattern with '\n'
				for regulor expressions</em> <br> This option is relevant if the
			entered pattern has multiple lines and you have activated the
			options: <i>Regular Expressions</i> and <i>Single Pattern Mode</i>.
			By activating this option the system will automatically enhance the
			entered pattern with a new line character after each line of the
			pattern and consider it a single pattern for the search. A
			recommandation to use this option deactivated is that if you
			structure very complex patterns you can devide them in different
			lines for a better overview but you still want it to be considered a
			single pattern</li>
	</ul>


	<h2 class="heading">Project Specific Settings</h2>
	<p>Some preferences have to be configured directly at ABAP project level</p>
	<h3 class="heading">PCRE (Pearl compatible regular expressions)

	</div>

	<ul class="list">
		<li><em>Disable Extended Mode</em> <br> on a default basis
			the extended mode is activated and you have to escape the white
			spaces in your pattern. If you donÂ´t want to do that you activate
			this option and the spaces entered in the pattern are considered as
			they are</li>
		<li><em>Enable Single Line Mode</em> <br> If this option is
			enabled the "." will also match the new line character during the
			search.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class="heading">Parallel Processing</h3>
	<ul class="list">
		<li><em>Enable Parallel Processing</em> <br> by activating
			this checkbox the system will execute the search with parallel
			processes. Depending on the workload of the system the search will
			occupy a maximum of 10 processes if available.</li>
		<li><em>Server Group</em> <br> you can choose an existing
			server group which will be considered for the parallel processing. A
			validition of the entered value is available.</li>
