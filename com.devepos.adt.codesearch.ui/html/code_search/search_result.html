	<h3 class="heading">Retrieval of the Search Results</h3>
	<p>
		As the search has to process a high number of source code objects
		(depending on the scope definition) the result list is build up
		incrementally.<br> This way the user gets to see a part of the
		result, even if the search run is not finished yet. The objects in
		scope are split into multiple packages. The size of the packages can
		be set in the properties. The search will enhance the result tree with
		the found matches after each package. As long as the search is running
		a progress indicator in the eclipse status bar is informing about the
		completion level in percentage. In the extended toolbar of the search
		result you can find the <i>Runtime Information</i> of the search run.
		This overview shows how many objects have been scanned and the overall time
		needed for the scan.

	<h3 class="heading">Working with the Search Results</h3>
	<p>
		Once a search returns some results they are displayed in the <em>Search
			View</em>. <br>As a default the matches are grouped by the main
		object (e.g. Function group, class) and the object where it can be
		found ( e.g function module, method). For each match there are several
		options available
	</p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>Open the object in the corresponding eclipse editor (if one
			is registered for the type) and navigate to the line which contains
			the match by double clicking on it</li>
		<li>Navigate to the location of the next match via the context
			menu option <i>Next Match</i>
		</li>
		<li>Navigate to the location of the previous match via the
			context menu option <i>Previous Match</i>
		</li>
		<li>Select one or multiple matches and choose the context menu
			option <i>Delete Selected Matches</i> to remove them from the current
			result list. When refreshing the search result screen, the search is
			executed once again and the matches will be visible again in the
			result list
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Remove All Matches</i> is used to delete all matches
			from the result list. In case that this option is triggered while the
			search run is still processing, only the current data from the result
			list will be deleted. The matches returned by the search after
			triggering this option will be displayed regularly
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Copy</i> options, copies the text of the match in the
			clipboard
		</li>
	</ul>
