	<!-- Description of general setup of the Search view -->
	<p>The Code Search Dialog Page is structured into the following
		main sections</p>
	<ol class="list">
		<li>Search Pattern (mandatory)</li>
		<li>Object Selection</li>
		<li>Additional Settings</li>
	</ol>

	<h3 class="heading">Search Pattern</h3>
	<p>In the text area you can enter the search pattern. It can
		contain one or more patterns. In case of multiple patterns, each
		pattern has to be entered in a separate line. Additionally you have 2
		options to configure the search pattern</p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li><em>Ignore Case</em> <br> When this option is set the
			lower/upper case of the source code will be ignored</li>
		<li><em>Regular Expressions</em> <br> By setting this
			checkbox you specify that the entered pattern uses regular
			expressions</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class="heading">Object Selection</h3>
	<p>The object selection can be defined using 2 fields:
	<ul class="list">
		<li><em>Object Name</em> <br> A text input control to enter
			one or multiple object names to restrict the scope. Wildcards are
			supported. The end of each object name is automatically expanded by a
			<code class="code">*</code> if it does not end with <code
				class="code">&lt;</code>. Multiple object names are split by a space</li>
		<li><em>Filters</em> <br> A text control for entering the
			filters which will restrict the scope. This field provides assistance
			for the following criteria:
			<ul>
				<li>type</li>
				<li>owner</li>
				<li>package</li>
				<li>application component</li>
				<li>date of creation</li>
			</ul> All filters also provide further content assistance to see which
			options are available (see the following image)</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="alert info">
		<strong>TIP</strong><br> The filter control can also be used to
		exclude objects from the scope by using ! as the negation sign. <br>e.g.
		You can exclude objects of type class by using by using
		<code class="code">type: !clas</code>
	</div>

	<p>
		A more detailed configuration of the scope objects is possible for
		classes and function groups because these objects contain different
		includes. By default all includes associated with classes and function
		groups will be scanned during the search. You can explicitly specify
		which includes should be scanned clicking on the link behind the <i>Selected</i>
		radio button.

	<h3 class="heading">Additional Settings</h3>
	Additionally you have the following options to configure the behavior
	of the search
	<ul class="list">
		<li><em>Ignore Comment Lines</em> <br> If active the system
			will not search for the entered pattern in commented lines</li>
		<li><em>Multiline Search</em> <br> By setting this checkbox
			you specify that each source code object will be searched as a whole.
			That way it is possible to find patterns that span multiple lines. If
			the checkbox is not set the system will search only for matches which
			contain the pattern in a single line.</li>
		<li><em>Single Pattern mode</em> <br> As a default the
			search result will contain the source code files which contain at
			least on line from the search pattern. By setting this checkbox means
			that the whole content of the search pattern text area is considered
			as one pattern (relevant for multiline pattern). Further
			configuration setting for this option is available in the <i>General
				Settings</i></li>
		<li><em>Match All</em> <br> This checkbox is only relevant
			if the pattern contains more than one line. If this checkbox is set
			the system will search for source code files which contains all
			patterns listed in the search pattern text area <b>without</b>
			considering their order. <br>If this checkbox is not set the system will
			execute an OR search between all lines of the pattern individually</li>
		<li><em>Sequential Matching</em> <br> Checkbox is only
			relevant if the pattern contains more than one line. If this checkbox
			is set the system will search for source code files which contain all
			patterns listed in the search pattern text area <b>considering
				their order</b>. <br>If this checkbox is not set the system will
			execute an OR search between all lines of the pattern individually</li>
	</ul>
