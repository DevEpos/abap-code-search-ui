	<p>
		To enable even more precise search queries, there is the option to
		activate the <em>Sequential Matching</em> setting in the <em>Search
			dialog</em>. <br>This causes first of all that the source code is
		searched line by line.
	</p>
	<p>The search starts at the beginning of the file and tries to find
		a match for the first pattern. But only the very first one. After that
		the search continues from the hit with the next pattern in the
		sequence. When all patterns in the sequence have been processed, the
		search starts again with the first pattern. Provided that the end of
		the file has not yet been reached.</p>

	<p>If any pattern of the sequence is not found at some point, the
		processing of the current file will be aborted.</p>
