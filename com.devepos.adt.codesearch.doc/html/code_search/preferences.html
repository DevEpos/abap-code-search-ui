	<p>In the preferences menu you have the possibility to configure
		the following settings
	<ul class="list">
		<li><em>Concatenate lines of the search pattern with '\n'
				for regular expressions</em> <br> This option is relevant if the
			entered pattern has multiple lines and you have activated the
			options: <i>Regular Expressions</i> and <i>Single Pattern Mode</i>. <br>
			By activating this option the system will automatically enhance the
			entered pattern with a new line character after each line of the
			pattern and consider it a single pattern for the search. <br>A
			recommendation to use this option deactivated is that if you
			structure very complex patterns you can divide them in different
			lines for a better overview but you still want it to be considered a
			single pattern</li>
